# The C Programming Language (2nd Edition) by K&R Solutions

# 25.06.2020
Hello everyone. I have recently enrolled myself in a Masters in Computer Application program. The semester is going to kick off in July. 

We have C programming this semester. So I am trying to brush up my C programming knowledge. And what can be a better resource for learning C than K&R. I am going through the book chapter by chapter, completing all the given exercises. 

I don't have any experience whatsoever regarding GitHub. So I thought it is going to be a good opportunity for me to learn GitHub and C simulteanously by giving out solutions to the exercises. This will keep motivated too. 

For now this repository is going to be a work in progress. And it will be updated with exercise solutions as I go on.
